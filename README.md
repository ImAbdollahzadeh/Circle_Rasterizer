# Optimization
- SIMD (x86-SSE) optimization 

# Let's get started.
## Line-based pixel drawing in C
In our triangle_Rasterizer, I explained how to start with the top point and approach the side point of a triangle, then for every single step, we draw a horizontal line between two limit point on triangle's borders. For a circle, the strategy is similar. I start with the toppest point on a circle (north pole or the point at &theta; = 90°) and approach the point at the leftmost part of the circle (at &theta; = 180°). For every single step, I draw a horizontal line in order to cover a semi circle from &theta; = 0° to &theta = 180°. I, then, repeat the same for angles between 180° to 360°.

## Circles

Okay, now it is time to define a circle as follows:

	typedef struct _circle {
 		point*   center;
		float    radius;
		COLORREF color;
	} circle;

I pass the circle's object to function ***line_based_dword_fillup_circle***.

	void line_based_dword_fillup_circle(circle* cr)
	{
		COLORREF* framebuffer = (COLORREF*)fb;
	
		/* strat from top point at angle 90° towards point at angle 180° */
		float        top_x              = cr->center->x;
		float        top_y              = cr->center->y - cr->radius;
		float        r_squared          = (cr->radius * cr->radius);
		float        left_side_x        = top_x - cr->radius;
		float        left_side_y        = cr->center->y;
		float        next_y             = top_y;
		float        next_x             = top_x;
		float        delY               = 0.0f;
		unsigned int this_pixel         = 0;
		unsigned int pixel_number       = 0;
		unsigned int mirror_pixel       = 0;
		unsigned int uint_center_y_copy = (unsigned int)(cr->center->y);
	
		while (next_y <= left_side_y)
		{
			delY = next_y - cr->center->y;
			next_x = top_x - sqrt(r_squared - (delY * delY));
	
			/* make an alias for better performance in next two lines */
			unsigned int next_x_copy = (unsigned int)next_x;
	
			this_pixel   = (next_x_copy + ((unsigned int)next_y * WIDTH));
			mirror_pixel = (next_x_copy + WIDTH * (uint_center_y_copy + (unsigned int)(cr->center->y - next_y)));
			pixel_number = (unsigned int)((cr->center->x - next_x)) << 1;
			while (pixel_number--)
				framebuffer[this_pixel++] = framebuffer[mirror_pixel++] = cr->color;
			next_y++;
		}
	}

While we go one step in y direction down, we calculate the x component of the left side limit pixel. Based on this x component, we therefore calcualte the x component of the limit pixel at the oppsite side of the circle. Then fill up this scanline.

Similar words to the triangle blit, the heart of the rasterizer is where we can work on to accelerate the blitting. For this reason I use x86-SSE optimization. If we concentrate on the way both limit points defined, we come up with this fact that, it cannot use packed floating point instructions since a line pixel can be anywhere on screen and any attampt to make it 16-byte aligned, would be a speed killer, and better to stick with the un-aligned instructions. Also I used inline assembly and not a separate .asm file (to tolerate the overhead of function epilogue and prologue).

	void accelerated_line_based_xmmword_fillup_circle(circle* cr)
	{
		/* construct super color */
		__declspec(align(16)) COLORREF _super_color[4] = { cr->color, cr->color , cr->color , cr->color };
	
		/* strat from top point at angle 90° towards point at angle 180° */
		float        top_x              = cr->center->x;
		float        top_y              = cr->center->y - cr->radius;
		float        r_squared          = (cr->radius * cr->radius);
		float        left_side_x        = top_x - cr->radius;
		float        left_side_y        = cr->center->y;
		float        next_y             = top_y;
		float        next_x             = top_x;
		float        delY               = 0.0f;
		unsigned int this_pixel         = 0;
		unsigned int pixel_number       = 0;
		unsigned int mirror_pixel       = 0;
		unsigned int uint_center_y_copy = (unsigned int)(cr->center->y);
	
		while (next_y <= left_side_y)
		{
			delY = next_y - cr->center->y;
			next_x = top_x - sqrt(r_squared - (delY * delY));
	
			/* make an alias for better performance in next two lines */
			unsigned int next_x_copy = (unsigned int)next_x;
	
			this_pixel   = (next_x_copy + ((unsigned int)next_y * WIDTH));
			mirror_pixel = (next_x_copy + WIDTH * (uint_center_y_copy + (unsigned int)(cr->center->y - next_y)));
			pixel_number = (unsigned int)((cr->center->x - next_x)) << 1;
	
			//--------------------------- SIMD OPTIMIZED LINE RASTERIZER -------------------------------
			/* 16 byte */
			unsigned int   total_bytes_in_line = pixel_number << 2;
			unsigned int   xmmwords_number = total_bytes_in_line >> 4;
			unsigned int   _16_bytes_blocks_in_line = (xmmwords_number << 4);
			unsigned char* start_of_line_in_framebuffer = fb + (this_pixel << 2);
			unsigned char* start_of_mirror_line_in_framebuffer = fb + (mirror_pixel << 2);
			unsigned int*  start_of_final_dwords_in_framebuffer = NULL;
			unsigned int*  start_of_final_mirror_dwords_in_framebuffer = NULL;
			__asm {
				mov    edi, start_of_line_in_framebuffer
				mov    esi, start_of_mirror_line_in_framebuffer
				mov    ecx, xmmwords_number
			// sanity check
				cmp    ecx, 0
				je     _accelerated_blit_end_
				movaps  xmm0, _super_color
				movaps  xmm1, xmm0
			_accelerated_blit_:
				movups xmmword ptr[edi], xmm0
				movups xmmword ptr[esi], xmm1
				sub    ecx, 1
				add    edi, 16
				add    esi, 16
				cmp    ecx, 0
				je     _accelerated_blit_end_
				jmp    _accelerated_blit_
			_accelerated_blit_end_:
				mov    start_of_final_dwords_in_framebuffer, edi
				mov    start_of_final_mirror_dwords_in_framebuffer, esi
			}
	
			/* 4 byte */
			unsigned int dwords = (total_bytes_in_line - _16_bytes_blocks_in_line) >> 2;
			while (dwords--)
				*start_of_final_dwords_in_framebuffer++ = *start_of_final_mirror_dwords_in_framebuffer++ = cr->color;
			//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
			next_y++;
		}
	}

This is, in my opinion, the fastest way to paint a aliased circle based on the scanline method with SIMD acceleration.

In function ***accelerated_line_based_xmmword_fillup_circle***, all the calculations are similar to those of ***line_based_dword_fillup_circle***, but instead of DWORD blit, I separated blocks of XMMWORDs and used 16-byte blit and finally some DWORD blit at the very end. 

The benchmarking made it clear that ***accelerated_line_based_xmmword_fillup_circle*** is simply 3.8 times faster than ***line_based_dword_fillup_circle***. A single core CPU spent nearly ***0.68 ms*** to paint the represented triangle above with ***line_based_dword_fillup_circle*** and the same with ***0.19 ms*** in ***accelerated_line_based_xmmword_fillup_circle***.

## Some notes on hardware accelerated triangle blit

Imagine a GPU designed for triangle raterization. This GPU has over 1000 parallel cores. In our *accelerated_line_based_xmmword_fillup_triangle*, there is 

	while (next_y <= left_side_y)
	{
		...
		next_y++;
	}
	
Our GPU can break this statement into **dy** cores (if dy < number_of_GPU_cores) and do all calculations in parallel, or into **number_of_GPU_cores** cores (if number_of_GPU_cores < dy) and in some small steps do the whole painting. With this in mind, we see that if dy < number_of_GPU_cores we get dy factor in acceleration and if number_of_GPU_cores < dy, we would get (number_of_GPU_cores * (dy / number_of_GPU_cores)) + (dy % number_of_GPU_cores) factor in acceleration. 

I mentioned at the end of my ***Triangle_Rasterizer tutorial*** that one can draw circles from triangles building blocks and spend nearly 300 msec to draw a large circle. As I also mentioned there, this is not efficient at all. Here I tried to show you that we can draw such a large circle with time below 200 &mu;sec.
